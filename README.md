# THEY SAY IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!
#### Well, there's only a 1 in 365 (or 366 for leap years) of me having the same birthday too, yeah!

### A simple program to practice DateTime in Java
- Get user's birthday
- Parse date
- FIND:
  -  day of the week user was born
  - day of the week it falls/fell this year
  - today's date and how many days until user's birthday
  - how many years old they'll be on the user's next birthday
- Ask if user wants to try a different date
